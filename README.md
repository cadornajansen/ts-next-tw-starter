## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the template by modifying `app/`. 

`API routes` with [Route handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/jokes](http://localhost:3000/api/jokes). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/jokes/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
